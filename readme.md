# AlexChat: A Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Chat Over AlexMesh

**AlexChat** is a chat application that runs on top of **AlexMesh**, a custom Layer 3 + Layer 4 network protocol that operates directly over Ethernet frames without using IP. This project demonstrates real-time communication between nodes in a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network stack built from scratch.

---

## üì° How It Works

AlexChat builds on the AlexMesh protocol stack:

- **AlexMesh (L3)** handles node discovery, addressing, and mesh-based routing over raw Ethernet (using a custom EtherType).
- **AlexStream (L4)** implements reliable communication, session control, sequencing, and acknowledgments, similar to TCP.
- **AlexChat** is the application layer that enables interactive messaging between nodes.

No IP, no TCP, no NAT. Just pure Layer 2+3+4, designed and implemented from scratch.

pip install scapy
```

### üîß Run Server
```bash
sudo python3 alexchat_server.py <interface>
```

### üí¨ Run Client
```bash
sudo python3 alexchat_client.py <interface> <server_mac>
```

### Example
```
sudo python3 alexchat_server.py en0
sudo python3 alexchat_client.py en0 6a:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
```

## üß† Why?

This project is a proof-of-concept for:
- Local-only communication without any IP stack
- Peer-to-peer sessions with custom protocol logic
- Full control of Layer 2-4
- Educational exploration of OSI stack internals

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This software is experimental and runs with raw socket access. It is not encrypted and is intended for local LAN testing and learning purposes.
